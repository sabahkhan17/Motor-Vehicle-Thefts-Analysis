# Motor Vehicle Theft Analysis - SQL Project

## Project Overview

This project analyzes motor vehicle theft trends using SQL queries and visualizations. The goal is to uncover patterns, identify high-risk areas, and understand factors influencing vehicle thefts using data-driven insights.

### 📊  Key Insights

**1. Total Stolen Vehicles:** "The dataset reveals that a total of 4,553 vehicles were reported stolen."

**2. Most Affected Region:** "Auckland has the highest number of vehicle thefts, accounting for 1.6K incidents."

**3. Most Commonly Stolen Vehicle Type:** "Station wagons and saloons are the most stolen vehicle types, making up 27.09% and 24.4% of thefts, respectively."

**4. Model Year with Highest Thefts:** "Vehicles manufactured in 2005 have the highest theft count, indicating older models are more vulnerable."

**5. Top 5 Stolen Vehicle Makes:** "Toyota, Trailer, Nissan, Mazda, and Ford are the most commonly stolen brands."

**6. Theft Trends by Population Density:** "Urban areas experience higher theft rates than rural regions due to increased vehicle density."

**7. Theft Growth Rate:** "Manawatu-Whanganui shows the fastest-growing theft trend, with a significant increase of 128.57% in the analyzed period."

### 📌 Data-Driven Recommendations for Business Growth

**Vehicle Security Enhancement:** Encourage car owners to use immobilizers, GPS trackers, and steering locks to reduce theft risks.

**Law Enforcement Resource Allocation:** Authorities can focus on high-risk areas like Auckland for better prevention strategies.

**Public Awareness Campaigns:** Targeted awareness programs can help vehicle owners take necessary precautions in high-theft zones.

**Dealership and Manufacturer Insights:** Car manufacturers can improve anti-theft measures in commonly stolen models.

**Improved Parking Security Measures:** Urban centers should implement better surveillance and lighting in high-theft areas.

**Real-Time Theft Monitoring:** Leveraging AI-based surveillance systems for early theft detection.

### 🛠️ SQL Functions Used

To streamline analysis, two SQL functions were developed:

`GetStolenVehiclesByRegion(region_name VARCHAR)` – Retrieves stolen vehicles from a specific region.

`GETMOSTSTOLENVEHICLETYPES(TOP_N INT)` – Returns the top N most stolen vehicle types.


### 📊 Visualizations

This project also includes a Power BI dashboard for better insights. The dashboard highlights:

* Total stolen vehicles

* Theft trends over months

* Most affected regions and vehicle makes

* Theft distribution by vehicle type and region

* Theft density and high-risk areas

* Growth trends in theft rates
